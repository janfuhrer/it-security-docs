## RSA Basic Idea

![[RSA.png]]

- Security is based on the hardness of the FACTORING problem

*GPT*
- In the RSA cryptosystem, `e` and `d` are chosen such that they are coprime to `phi(n)`. They are exponents used for encryption and decryption, respectively, and are not required to be coprime to `n`. Their being coprime to `phi(n)` ensures they are multiplicative inverses of each other modulo `phi(n)`, which is a requirement for RSA to function correctly (`e * d â‰¡ 1 (mod phi(n))`).

- The message `m` in RSA encryption and decryption is an element of $Z_n$, the set of all integers modulo `n`. It is not required to be an element of $Z_n^*$ (the set of integers coprime to `n`), because the RSA processes involve exponentiation modulo `n` (not multiplication), and these operations don't require `m` to have a multiplicative inverse modulo `n`.

- However, in practice, it can be beneficial for security reasons to ensure that `m` is coprime to `n`, particularly when `m` contains sensitive information.

- Not IND-CPA because encrypting the same input with the same public key always results in the same output.
- Malleable because an attacker who knows $c$ for some plaintext $m$ can create a ciphertext for $2m$ without knowing $m$.

- Instead of encrypting $m$ ($modExp(m)$) a randomized m* is calculated which is then encrypted
