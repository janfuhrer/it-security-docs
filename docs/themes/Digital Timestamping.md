## Digital Timestamping

A "trustworthy time" is crucial for a PKI.
- CAs should issue/revoke certicates based on a trustworthy time. This service is mandatory for accredited CAs issuing advanced or qualied certicates.
- A trustworthy timestamp should be added every time a user "digitally signs" a document to achieve a higher level of legal probative value.

If the content of a document is additionally digitally time-stamped by a trustworthy DTS, it makes time of creation provable in the future.
