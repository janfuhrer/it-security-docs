## What is key revocation?

The process of invalidation a cryptographic key pair. It's used when a key is compromised or no longer required.

### Certificate Revocation Lists (X.509)

CRL is a list of certs which have been revoked by the issuing CA before their scheduled expiration date.

### Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)

Protocol used to obtain the revocation status of a cert. Instead of having to parsing a list of revoked certs itself, a client sends a query to an OCSP responder and receives information about a single cert.

### OCSP Stapling (TLS)

The server itself periodically retrieves OCSP response for its own cert and "staples" it to the TLS handshake which means the client doesn't have to contact the OCSP himself.

**Publish Revocation in blockchain**

Revocations could be published on the blockchain. Similar to CRL but decentralised, don't have to trust CA.

### Controlled flooding

Revocations (signed with private key) can be flooded through a network. It's controlled in that each message is only re broadcasted a certain number of times to prevent endless loops. Efficient set reconciliation ([[Bloom Filters & Set Unification]]) is used to compare the sets of revoked certs when nodes first connect to make sure they both have the same state. Proof of work is used to limit DoS-potential. POW can be calculated ahead of time and stored offline to have them read in case they are needed.
